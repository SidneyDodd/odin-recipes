<p>These blueberry pancakes are an excellent way to start your morning. Fresh blueberries and fluffy pancakes will give you the nutrition and energy you need to start your day.</p>
<p><h1><strong>Ingredients</strong></h1></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup milk, plus more if needed</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>1 stick butter, melted</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
</ul></p>
<h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>
<ol>
    <li>Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large mixing bowl. In a separate large bowl, lightly whisk the eggs. Add the milk, sour cream, half the melted butter and the vanilla, whisking to blend. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the egg mixture into it. Whisk the ingredients together just until blended. Fold the blueberries and lemon zest into the batter. </li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with some of the remaining melted butter. For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the hot skillet. Cook 3 or 4 pancakes at a time, depending on the size of the skillet. If the batter seems too thick, thin it with 1 to 2 tablespoons milk. When bubbles begin to form and "pop" on the pancake's surface, after about 1 minute, and the outer edge looks done, flip it over and cook briefly for about 30 seconds on the other side.</li>
